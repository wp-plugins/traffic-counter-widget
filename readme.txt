== Description ==

Counts the number of pages visited by the users of your blog and shows it in a widget.

It shows the number of visitors in the past 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. It also shows the number of users currently online.

It does not have (yet) a robots filter, so the automatic traffic is also considered (however this should be in your benefit). Traffic Counter Widget also offers language support on your widget

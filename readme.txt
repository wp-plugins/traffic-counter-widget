TCW lets your users know how much traffic you have on your blog. It counts pages visited, hits and unique IPs on your blog and shows it in a widget. It also shows the number of users currently online.

== Description ==

TCW shows the number of visitors / hits / unique IPs in the past 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. It also shows the number of users currently online.

It provides a robots filter, but the automatic traffic could also be considered. 

Traffic Counter Widget offers language support and automatic log deletion.
